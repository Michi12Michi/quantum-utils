- ## Blocking analysis
  When dealing with time series data from Monte Carlo simulations or physical measurements, data may be (too often!) statistically correlated: this implies that each new configuration of the system depends on the previous ones, and thus the system _remembers_ its previous state. In these cases, the true statistical error is found to be greater than the simple standard deviation of the mean. \
  For independent data points, the standard error of the mean is given by: \
  $\sigma_{mean} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$.
